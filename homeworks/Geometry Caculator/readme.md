## Code Plan
### This program is a caculator let user pick a geometry and input the dimensions or radius. Then output the result either area or volum.
#### .inputs
#### .different geometry equation
#### .output
#### .message the result
### First I need the user to tell me what geometry they pick. Also input the dimension or radius of their geometry. They click submit for the results. In my function I get those value into different geometry formulas. Then have the message to tell them the results.
