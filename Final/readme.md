# Final Project idea

## IDEA 1
### Using p5.particle to make a firework simulation. You could change the color, size, shape and also design your own firework. Adding multiple fireworks together sounds fun...Combining with grafica.js, smoke effect could be created.

## IDEA 2
### Using p5.play to make a University of Miami lake crossing game. The lake full of crocodiles. Our character is a bear name bubu. You want to lead him swim cross the lake by using a fish to attract him. The fish follow the mouse and the bear follow the fish. Your goal is to help the bear across the lake safely while using least amount of fish.

## IDEA 3
### Using the p5.dom and p5.sound to make A cappella program by mix pre record voice. Like a beatbox machine.

# FIRST CODE PLAN
### The game would be a crossing road like game. My character bear would start from the bottom of the canvas and then move up to the top in order to win the game. Crocodiles would move from cross the canvas in rows. First I will make the bear moving. And have crocdiles moving.I will create two Sprites. My main character will move to the direction of mouseX and mouseY after mousePressed.Later on the interaction would be user throw fish to attract the bear in order to lead him to the other shore.

# Final Code Plan
### I am struggling with the animation and Sprite. Not as I expected. So I shift my focus away from art assets. I focus on having the game function well. To make it able to play first. I would make the bear rectangle, fish triangle, and aligators circle. 5 limits of fish and numbers of aligator across. I setup my charact start at the left of my canvas. I will set variable fish number at five. Having 5 aligators randomly acrossing the canvas vertically by using aligatorX[i] and aligatorY[i]. If the player lead Bubu across the cavans to the right shore, they will get a win message.
