# Final Project idea

## IDEA 1
### Using p5.particle to make a firework simulation. You could change the color, size, shape and also design your own firework. Adding multiple fireworks together sounds fun...Combining with grafica.js, smoke effect could be created.

## IDEA 2
### Using p5.play to make a University of Miami lake crossing game. The lake full of crocodiles. Our character is a bear name bubu. You want to lead him swim cross the lake by using a fish to attract him. The fish follow the mouse and the bear follow the fish. Your goal is to help the bear across the lake safely while using least amount of fish.

## IDEA 3
### Using the p5.dom and p5.sound to make A cappella program by mix pre record voice. Like a beatbox machine.

# FIRST CODE PLAN
### The game would be a crossing road like game. My character bear would start from the bottom of the canvas and then move up to the top in order to win the game. Crocodiles would move from cross the canvas in rows. First I will make the bear moving. And have crocdiles moving.
